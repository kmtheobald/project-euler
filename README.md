See https://projecteuler.net

As a challenge to myself, this repository represents my attempt to solve the
first 100 Project Euler problems. In doing so, I hope to utilize material I was
fortunate enough to learn through my degree as well as gain exposure to
algorithms and data structures important to computer science.

Completed problems: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 
                    11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20
                    21, 22, 24
                    63
                    97

"Note: The rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply
to the first 100 problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct
methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine
the enjoyment of solving later problems. Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of
helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our
requirements, then we give permission for them to be discussed elsewhere."
