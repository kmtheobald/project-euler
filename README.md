# project_euler

See https://projecteuler.net

Although I cannot find the exact wording on the Project Euler website itself,
my understanding is that it is allowable to post solutions to the first 100 or
so problems as long as discussion is included. 

As a challenge to myself, this repository represents my attempt to solve the
first 100 problems. In doing so, I hope to cement knowledge from my math degree
as well as learn algorithms and data structures important to computer science
and programming as a whole.

Completed problems: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 
                    11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20
